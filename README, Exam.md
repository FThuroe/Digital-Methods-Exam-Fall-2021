# Digital-Methods-Exam-Fall-2021

This README-file will explain the different files in this repository. 

First you have the two files, Final_Project.html and Final_Project.Rmd, which is both my RMarkdown script and the knitted version of the same.  Next, you find my three datasets, as .csv-files. The first one - Tidy_data_numbers_2000.csv - contains the data for the year 2000.  The next one - Tidy_data_europe.csv - contains the same data, but just for European countries.  The last one - Miltary_Expenditure_tidy_2020.csv - contains the data for European countries in 2020. 

Lastly, you find my homework for week 47 called: W47_MakeItMove, Frederik_Thur√∏e.html. This is because it's a GIF and couldn't work properly as a PDF file.
